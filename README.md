LiCe is a powerful, yet easy-to-use script pack for the EPIC irc client. EPIC itself is an amazing piece of software, flexible and powerful. It is however designed to be scripted and that's where LiCe comes in.

LiCe is one of the oldest IRC scripts there is. Originally for ircII version 2, it was then built for EPIC3, then EPIC4. srfrog stopped developing it after EPIC4 was released, however whitefang and tjh are now developing it for EPIC5, starting on the base work done by HSOC.

LiCe makes IRC much more fun. It has the following powerful features built into it:

Friend Lists
Shit Lists
Auto Updating Ability
Themes

That's just a small subset of the excellent features LiCe has.

Download EPIC, download LiCe and experience IRC as it's supposed to be.
