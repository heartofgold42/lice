+ LiCe Flood Routines +
-----------------------

LiCe flood protection is broken down into two catagories
The first is channel (or public) protections and the second is
private (or message) protections.

Each of these can be toggled globally using:
/TOG C - Toggle Public/Channel protections
/TOG F - Toggle Private/Message protections

If they are toggled off at the global level, they will not be 
triggered, regardless of other settings. Therefore if you wish
to disable all LiCe flood protections, ensure that TOG C and F
are off.

You can trigger how sensitive flood protection is using /SENS F

Public / Channel Proections
This flood protection is triggered if someone floods a channel
you are on with public messages. Usually this would be a big
wall of public text to the channel, but may be lots of nick
changes or joins/parts.

NOTE:These will not be triggered unless you are a chanop in the
channel being flooded. The reason for this is because you are
unable to do anything (kick/ban) the flooder unless you are an
op.

For chanops, the flood protection works like this:

If the flooder is in your FRIEND list with the +F
flag, no flood protection will be triggered.

If /CTOG C is on, the flooder will be kicked unless:
  /CTOG O is on, and the flooder is an OP
  /CTOG V is on, and the flooder is a Voice

If /CTOG C is off, the flooder will not be kicked.

If /CTOG F is on, the flooder will be banned (regardless of
the state of /CTOG C) 

Private / Message Protections
These are triggered if someone sends you a lot of MSG/NOTICE/
CTCP messages.

There is no control offered other than the global settings.

If you are flooded, you will automatically IGNORE the person
flooding you.  This will be:
  Permanently if /SENS 2 is 0
  Temporary, for the amount of seconds that /SENS 2 is set to.

Additionally, the client will fully isolate itself, that is 
IGNORE *!*@* for the number of seconds in /SENS I.  This helps
ensure client stability.  If the server supports SILENCE or
CALLERID (both forms of server-side ignore), these will be 
enabled as well for the amount of time in /SENS I.
