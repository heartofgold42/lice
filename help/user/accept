UMODE +g is a setting that some servers support, that is a form of server
side ignore.
When UMODE +g is set, you can only recieve messages from NICK's on your
accept list.  This allows you to manage this list.

ACCEPT -l will show you your current accept list
ACCEPT -a tjh whitefang - will add tjh and whitefang to the list you'll
accept messages from
ACCEPT -d tjh whitefang - will remove tjh and whitefrom from the list you'll
acept messages from

   Note: Only some servers support accept. This command will report
   if your server doesn't support it. Servers that don't support accept
   may use the SILENCE command instead.
